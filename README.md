This project is used in the [Build UI Using Swing](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/design-gui-using-swing.html) tutorial. 

In this tutorial you learn the basics of working with the UI Designer and you build your own GUI form. The sample application you build is called Book Editor, and it is used to add the information about a book, such as its title, author, genre, and availability status.
